# LandingPage

Project two of the Udacity nanodegree course.

# How it works

The project first finds all section headings and stores them in an array for later use.
Then the navbar is created from this list and the resulting navbar items are stored in an array so that their order is the same.

On click of a navbar-item, the page is scrolled to the corresponding section.

On scrolling, the currently visible section is colored blue. The navbar-items or the visible sections are highlighted with a red border.
